Source files are found in src/
Executables are found in target/
Javadoc html files are found in javadoc/ 

To run the program, go to target/ and 
run the following command from the command line:

java Client

To look at the javadoc html files for the classes, go to javadoc/ 
and use a webbrowser to open Client.html, Product.html and Inventory.html
The html files are reliant on the various other files in the javadoc 
directory, so they must be opened from that folder.
